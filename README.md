GPS Auto Dashboard
====================

<ul>
<li>GPS Auto Dashboard is an Android app that was created for the purpose of bringing a digital speedometer, along with additional statistics, to any automobile.</li>
<li>Using the Android device's built-in Global Positioning System (GPS), this app is able to calculate your speed, acceleration, distance traveled, and location coordinates.</li>
<li>This app features an automatic day-and-night theme switching algorithm. Which means as you are driving the app will automatically switch to either the light or dark theme, depending on the light conditions.</li>
<li>This app also features an acceleration bar widget to give you an indication of how fast, or slow, you are either accelerating or braking.</li>
</ul>
